# Predictive-Modelling
This presentation outlines a comprehensive predictive modeling project aimed at developing a loan approval prediction system. Leveraging the Loan Prediction dataset from Kaggle, the project utilizes data analytics and machine learning techniques to forecast whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on applicant characteristics.

The focus of this study is on analyzing customer-related attributes such as income levels, credit history, marital status, education, property area, and loan-specific variables like loan amount and loan term. Through this analysis, the goal is to identify key factors that significantly influence loan approval outcomes.

To achieve this, the dataset was explored using statistical visualizations to uncover trends and correlations. Further, a logistic regression model was trained and evaluated for its ability to predict loan approval status effectively. Key insights related to gender distribution, education level, credit history, and property area were extracted to assist in understanding customer behavior and financial risk.

Ultimately, this project aims to support financial institutions by providing a data-driven approach to improving loan approval processes, minimizing default risks, and refining customer targeting strategies.
